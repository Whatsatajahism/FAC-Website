                <h2>Who even are you?</h2>
                    <p id="user-greeting">Hi, <span id="user-name">User</span>! You might have already guessed, but I'm Tajah, and my pronouns are They/Them. I have spent my entire career working with people. 
                        First, as an EFL teacher in Spain (shout out to Santiago de Compostela and Sevilla, you were great cities to live in!), then in an LGBTQ+ charity in London, where I felt my identity was getting to tied up in my day job, 
                        and most recently in a university. But I liked education more than I like working for an educational institution. 
                        I love people, but I don't want to make people my career. And so, I started to learn how to code, to give myself more career options.
                    </p>

                <h2>Is this where you tell us why you're switching to tech?</h2>
                    <p id="second-para">Yes dear <span id="user-name">reader</span>, it is. I first tried coding in 2022, and not to be dramatic, but it changed the course of my life. I had an 8 week course in Python with CodeFirstGirls, and from then on I was hooked.
                        I taught myself Ruby on Codeacademy, and then Javascript. But this year was the first time where I actually applied it to my own little websites after taking a full-stack web dev course on Udemy. 
                        I only decided it was worth doing this after finding FAC in a Google search and realising how much I still needed to learn. So, thank you for the inspiration!

                <h2>Learning is what? FUNDAMENTAL!</h2>
                    <p> I really do love learning, and so I want to showcase the amount of hours that have gone into the projects I've made over the last few months, beyond the Founders and Coders requirements. 
                    Hopefully, it will also show you my progress with software development. Click on the buttons above to see other things I've created. Enjoy judging me!

            <div class="item interests">
                <h2>Interests beyond coding</h2>
                    <p>Beyond coding, I'm a green belt in Taekwondo, which is a Korean martial art. I've found it to be an invaluable way to align my bodymind in a very mentally unhealthy world. 
                    I also taught myself how to use nunchuks (for tricks rather than battle), and love cooking up new recipes!
                    I'm very much a jack of all trades, master of none, but it does mean that I usually have lots of random bits of trivia up my sleeve for any occasion!
                    I just really like trying new things, and hope it's a quality I never lose to the capitalist machine.

                <p>Coding takes a lot of mental concentration for me, not too dissimilar to what I need to keep this nunchuk spinning without hurting myself!</p>
